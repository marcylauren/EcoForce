    <p style="margin-left: 50px;">Space pollution is also an issue that a large majority of people down at Earth aren’t really informed about and how it could impact us in a negative way.  More specifically Space debris is an ongoing issue that is slowly accumulating into a much larger issue the more Satellites and other man made objects we send into space. There are sometimes destroyed or field launches of satellites by some countries that also led to more space debris surrounding Earth. There are a total of 30,000  Manmade objects within Earth's orbit and there are over 6,000 active satellites in orbit as well. There is also a major factor contributing to the causes of the space debris which is India’s Space mission called “Mission Shakti”. India Launched an anti-satellite test that is intentionally designed to destroy a satellite while in its orbit around Earth. After the missile successfully  destroyed the satellite; large and small pieces were left orbiting Earth at a very fast velocity that could last for days, weeks, or even a year.</p>
